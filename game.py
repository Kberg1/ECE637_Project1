    state : 3 x 3 array
        Possible states are as follows:
        '-' - Position has not been played yet

        'o' - Position has been played by minimizer
    n_positions_open : int
        Number of open positions remaining on the board
    is_a_winner : boolean
        Whether or not there is a winner yet
    maximizer : Object of the Maximizer class
        Player who attempts to maximize the eval function
    minimizer : Object of the Minimizer class
        Player who attempts to minimize the eval function

    Methods
    ---------
    Constructor - Initializes board to all positions open
    play_game - Play the game until there is a winner or the board is full (draw)
    draw_board - Draw the game board based on the current state
